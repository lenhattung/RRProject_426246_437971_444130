# Executive Summary

::: {.justify}

The aim of this project is to assess the validity of the published [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032116000848)
from a prominent publisher. namely, to check whether the published article is
consistent or not.  

:::
     
::: {.justify}

We decided to employ the reproducible research on the selected article
because of the fact that there are many articles in the literature in order to
investigate the relationship between energy consumption and energy use and
their result is somehow contradictory. The relationship between energy
consumption and carbon dioxide (indicator of environmental deterioration)
observed differently due to either dataset or/and region. Considering all of the
inconsistency it will be a great experience for us to check its validity.  

:::


The dataset of the article obtained from [World Data Bank Indicator](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator)   

Lastly related code and report published in [repository](RRProject_426246_437971_444130)
